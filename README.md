## Algorithm Explanation

The Drag and Carry Multiplication Algorithm works by separating the multiplication process into individual digit operations. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of how it functions:

1. **Input**: Two numbers are input for multiplication.
2. **Digit Extraction**: Each digit of the numbers is extracted and processed.
3. **Partial Products**: The algorithm computes partial products for each digit.
4. **Carry Handling**: The unique carry rule is applied to handle carries efficiently.
5. **Final Sum**: The final result is obtained by summing all partial products.

### Example

Letâ€™s say we want to multiply 23 and 45.

1. **Extract Digits**: 
   - 23 â†’ 2, 3
   - 45 â†’ 4, 5

2. **Compute Partial Products**:
   - 2 * 4 = 8
   - 2 * 5 = 10
   - 3 * 4 = 12
   - 3 * 5 = 15

3. **Apply Carry**: 
   - Handle the carries from the partial products.

4. **Final Sum**: 
   - Combine the results to get the final product.
